\section*{$\mathbf{0.1\le af\le 0.9\land cov\ge 10}$}
The resulting data from an \emph{ASEQ} run on the BAM files of the various condition after alignment with star has been filtered considering the following constraints:
  $$0.1\le af\le 0.9\qquad\land\qquad cov\ge 10$$
	These constraints yielded a result of a total of $111682$ unique \emph{SNP}, $939$ of which are shared across all conditions.
